# Train_data_from_3D_model (Work in progress)

- At the moment running *main.py* starts the rendering loop and image buffering and bulk saving is also functional 

When finished, the idea of this project is to be able to create training data for a image recognition neural network by using 3D-models. At the moment it is being developed by trying out simple primitive shapes (cone, cube, sphere) with a default texture. The 3D-models are currently created in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and exported as .obj-files. Using those files the given objects are rendered using [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/). Those renders are then used to take snapshots of the objects in different positions, angles, (enviroments, lighting) etc. These images are then saved locally for further use. In the future the idea is to create .tfrecord-files (pairing each image with a corresponding label) of these images and to upload them to a [MinIO](https://min.io/) client. Any training of an actual neural network will be done by utilizing [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
